kees 1948 Uniflex Serial Board Remake

This is my recreation of the Uniflex Serial Board. It is a merge of the SR4 and the US4 Board with some SMD Components. It has two pinouts for external modules. One with a RS232 Converter and a female SUB-D9 connector, and one for a USB-Serial Converter with USB-C or micro-USB Connector. The modules can be found on ebay.
